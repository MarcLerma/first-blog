    Who am I, you might be asking, and rightfully so. Well, my name is Marc, and you might already know that because it is on the main page. Whether you are a friend of mine that is supporting this blog that I have built, a stranged that stumbled across the link on social media, or a future friend of mine, I would like to personally and honestly say thank you. 
    <br>
            <br>
    Thank you for supporting me, and for taking the time to look at something I have created, without your support and feedback, this would not be where it is today, so give yourself a high-five and sit back and enjoy the rest of this about me article.

    The real question is who are you?
